The `ejb-in-ear` quickstart demonstrates how to deploy an EAR archive that contains a *JSF* WAR and an EJB JAR.

== What is it?

The `ejb-in-ear` quickstart demonstrates the deployment of an EAR artifact to {productNameFull}. The EAR contains a JSF WAR and an EJB JAR.

This example consists of the following Maven projects, each with a shared parent.

[cols="30%,70%",options="headers"]
|===
|Project |Description

| `ejb`
| This project contains the EJB code and can be built independently to produce the JAR archive.

| `web`
| This project contains the JSF pages and the managed bean.

| `ear`
| This project builds the EAR artifact and pulls in the EJB and web artifacts.
|===

The root `pom.xml` builds each of the subprojects in the above order and deploys the EAR archive to the server.

The example follows the common "Hello World" pattern, using the following workflow.

. A JSF page asks for a user name.
. On clicking *Greet*, the name is sent to a managed bean named `Greeter`.
. On setting the name, the `Greeter` invokes the `GreeterEJB`, which was injected to the managed bean. Notice the field is annotated with `@EJB`.
. The response from invoking the `GreeterEJB` is stored in a field (message) of the managed bean.
. The managed bean is annotated as `@SessionScoped`, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session. This ensures that the message is available when the page reloads and is displayed to the user.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `ear/target/{artifactId}.ear` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

Enter a name in the input field and click the *Greet* button to see the response.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+

$ mvn wildfly:undeploy

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

For this quickstart, follow the special instructions to build link:{useEclipseDeployEARDocUrl}[Quickstarts Containing an EAR].

. Right-click on the *{artifactId}-ear* subproject, and choose *Run As* -> *Run on Server*.
. Choose the server and click *Finish*.
. This starts the server, deploys the application, and opens a browser window that accesses the running application.
. To undeploy the project, right-click on the *{artifactId}-ear* project and choose *Run As* -> *Maven build*. Enter `wildfly:undeploy` for the *Goals* and click *Run*.

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.
