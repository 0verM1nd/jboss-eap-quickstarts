== What is it?

The `helloworld-html5` quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI 1.2 and JAX-RS 2.0 in {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later using the HTML5 + REST architecture.

The application is basically a smart, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript front-end using RESTful services on the backend.

* `HelloWorld.java`: Establishes the RESTful endpoints using JAX-RS.
* `web.xml`: Maps RESTful endpoints to `/hello`.
* `index.html`: Is a jQuery augmented plain old HTML5 web page.

The example can be deployed using Maven from the command line or from Eclipse using JBoss Tools.

// Additional requirements for this quickstart.
An HTML5 compatible browser such as Chrome, Safari 5+, Firefox 5+, or IE 9+ is required.

With the prerequisites out of the way, you are ready to build and deploy.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

You can also test the REST endpoint by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the URLs below. Replace `__YOUR_NAME__` with a name of your choosing.

* The XML content can be tested by sending an HTTP `POST` to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/hello/xml/__YOUR_NAME__

** To issue the `POST` command using cURL, type the following command in terminal:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/hello/xml/__YOUR_NAME__
----

** You will see the following response:

* The JSON content can be tested by sending an HTTP `POST` to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/hello/json/__YOUR_NAME__

** To issue the `POST` command using cURL, type the following command in terminal:

== Run the Arquillian Functional Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under the root directory of this quickstart.
Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.

To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

. Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.

. If you have a running instance of the {productName} server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

. If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the {productName} server, meaning the tests will start the server for you, type fhe following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-managed
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn dependency:sources
$ mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
