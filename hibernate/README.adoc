[abstract]
The `hibernate` quickstart demonstrates how to use Hibernate ORM 5 API over JPA, using Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation, and EJB.

== What is it?

The `hibernate` quickstart is based upon the link:../kitchensink/README.adoc[kitchensink] example, but demonstrates how to use Hibernate Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) 5 over JPA in {productNameFull}.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant Java EE 7 application using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA , Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation. It includes a persistence unit associated with Hibernate session and some sample persistence and transaction code to help you with database access in enterprise Java.

== Add the Correct Dependencies

{productName} provides Hibernate 5 and JPA support.

If you use Hibernate 5 packaged within {productName}, you will need to first import the JPA API.

This quickstart demonstrates usage of Hibernate Session and Hibernate Validators.

If you look at the `pom.xml` file in the root of the hibernate quickstart directory, you will see that the dependencies for the Hibernate modules have been added with the scope as `provided`.

For example:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
   <exclusions>
      <exclusion>
         <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
         <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
      </exclusion>
   </exclusions>
</dependency>

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].
