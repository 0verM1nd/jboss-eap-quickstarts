[abstract]
The `helloworld-mutual-ssl` quickstart is a basic example that demonstrates mutual SSL configuration in {productName}

== What is it?

Mutual SSL provides the same security as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server requests the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip each time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must buy and maintain a digital certificate.

This quickstart shows how to configure {productName} to enable TLS/SSL configuration for the new {productName} `undertow` subsystem and enable mutual (two-way) SSL authentication.

Before you run this example, you must create certificates and configure the server to use two-way SSL.

. The certificates and keystores are now properly configured.

== Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the SSL context by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file

** If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
** Back up the file: `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
** After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
For Linux:  {jbossHomeName}/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows:  {jbossHomeName}\bin\standalone.bat
----

. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing {jbossHomeName} with the path to your server:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
For Linux: {jbossHomeName}/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `key-store`s were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source, xml]
----
<key-store name="qsKeyStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>
    <file path="server.keystore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
</key-store>
<key-store name="qsTrustStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>
    <file path="client.truststore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
</key-store>
----

. The following `key-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source, xml]
----
<key-managers>
    <key-manager name="qsKeyManager" key-store="qsKeyStore">
        <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    </key-manager>
</key-managers>
----

. The following `trust-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

+
[source, xml]
----
<trust-managers>
    <trust-manager name="qsTrustManager" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>
</trust-managers>
----

. The following `ssl-context` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

+
[source, xml]
----
<server-ssl-contexts>
    <server-ssl-context name="qsSSLContext" protocols="TLSv1.2" need-client-auth="true" key-manager="qsKeyManager" trust-manager="qsTrustManager"/>
</server-ssl-contexts>
----

. The `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem was changed to reference the `qsSSLContext` `ssl-context`:

+
[source, xml]
----
<https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" ssl-context="qsSSLContext" enable-http2="true"/>
----
