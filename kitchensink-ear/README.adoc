[abstract]
The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart demonstrates web-enabled database application, using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA, and Bean Validation, packaged as an EAR.

== What is it?

The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 7 on {productNameFull}.

It demonstrates how to create a compliant Java EE 7 application using JSF, CDI, JAX-RS, EJB, JPA, and Bean Validation. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. It is based on the link:../kitchensink/README.md[kitchensink] quickstart but is packaged as an EAR archive.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with {productNameFull} {productVersion}. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in {productName} and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/[Configuration Guide] for {productNameFull}._

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts[Configure Maven for {productName} {productVersion}] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `{jbossHomeName}` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_{jbossHomeName}.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Start the Server

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\standalone.bat
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

----
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `ear/target/{artifactId}.ear` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/kitchensink-ear/.

. Enter a name, email address, and Phone nubmer in the input field and click the _Register_ button.
. If the data entered is valid, the new member will be registered and added to the _Members_ display list.
. If the data is not valid, you must fix the validation errors and try again.
. When the registration is successful, you will see a log message in the server console:

----
Registering _the_name_you_entered_
----

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

----
mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Arquillian Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

----
mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

You can also let Arquillian manage the {productName} server by using the `arq-managed` profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests[Run the Arquillian Tests].

== Investigate the Console Output

You should see the following console output when you run the tests:

----
Results :
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

== Investigate the Server Console Output

You should see messages similar to the following:

----
INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-3) WFLYSRV0027: Starting deployment of "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
...
INFO  [org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink_ear.service.MemberRegistration] (default task-102) Registering Jane Doe
INFO  [org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink_ear.test.MemberRegistrationTest] (default task-102) Jane Doe was persisted with id 1
...
INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-2) WFLYSRV0028: Stopped deployment test.war (runtime-name: test.war) in 38ms
....
INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 22) WFLYSRV0009: Undeployed "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
----

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

NOTE: You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

----
WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

For this quickstart, follow the special instructions to build https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#deploy-and-undeploy-a-quickstart-ear-project[Quickstarts Containing an EAR]

. Right-click on the `{artifactId}-ear` subproject, and choose `Run As` –&gt; `Run on Server`.
. Choose the server and click `Finish`.
. This starts the server, deploys the application, and opens a browser window that accesses the running application at http://localhost:8080/kitchensink-ear-web.
. To undeploy the project, right-click on the `{artifactId}-ear` project and choose `Run As` –&gt; `Maven build`. Enter `wildfly:undeploy` for the `Goals` and click `Run`.

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
    mvn dependency:sources
----
