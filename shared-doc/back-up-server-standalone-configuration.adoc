= Back Up the {productName} Standalone Server Configuration

Before you begin, back up your server configuration file.

ifdef::standalone-server-default[]
* If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
* Back up the file: `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
endif::[]

ifdef::standalone-server-full[]
* If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
* Back up the file: `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`
endif::[]

ifdef::standalone-server-full-ha[]
* If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
* Back up the file: `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml`
endif::[]

After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
