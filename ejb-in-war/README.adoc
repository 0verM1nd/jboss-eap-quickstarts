[abstract]
The `ejb-in-war` quickstart demonstrates how to package an EJB bean in a WAR archive and deploy it to {productName}. Arquillian tests are also provided.

== What is it?

The `ejb-in-war` quickstart demonstrates the deployment of an EJB bean bundled in a WAR archive for deployment to {productNameFull}. The project also includes a set of Arquillian tests for the managed bean and EJB.

The example follows the common "Hello World" pattern using the following workflow.

. A JSF page asks for the user name.
. On clicking *Greet*, the name is sent to a managed bean named `Greeter`.
. On setting the name, the `Greeter` invokes the `GreeterEJB`, which was injected into the managed bean. Notice the field annotated with `@EJB`.
. The response from invoking the `GreeterEJB` is stored in a field `message` of the managed bean.
. The managed bean is annotated as `@SessionScoped`, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session. This ensures that the message is available when the page reloads and is displayed to the user.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Arquillian Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:
+
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

You can also let Arquillian manage the {productName} server by using the `arq-managed` profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see link:{arquillianTestsDocUrl}[Run the Arquillian Tests].

== Investigate the Console Output

JUnit will present you test report summary:

----
Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

If you are interested in more details, check `target/surefire-reports` directory.
You can check console output to verify that Arquillian has really used the real application server.
Search for lines similar to the following ones in the server output log:

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
$ mvn dependency:sources
