[abstract]
The `app-client` quickstart demonstrates how to code and package a client app and use the {productName} client container to start the client Main program.

== What is it?

The `app-client` quickstart demonstrates how to use the {productName} client container to start the client `Main` program and provide Dependency Injections (DI) for client applications in {productNameFull}. It also shows you how to use Maven to package the application according to the JavaEE specification.

This example consists of the following Maven projects, each with a shared parent:

[cols="<,<"]
|===
|*Sub-project* |*Description* 

|`ejb` |An application that can be called by the `client`.
|`ear` |The EAR packaging contains the server and client side.
|`client-simple` |A simple client application for running in the application-client container to show the injection
|===

The root `pom.xml` file builds each of the subprojects in the appropriate order.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts[Configure Maven for {productName} {productVersion}] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `{jbossHomeName}` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_{jbossHomeName}.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Add the Application Users

If the client and server are run on different hosts, you must add the following users to the {productName} server side application. Be sure to use the names and passwords specified in the table as they are required to run this example.

[cols="<,<,<,<"]
|===
|*UserName* |*Realm* |*Password* |*Roles* 

|admin |ManagementRealm |admin-123 |_leave blank for none_ 
|quickuser |ApplicationRealm |quick-123 |_leave blank for none_ 
|===

To add the users, open a command prompt and type the following commands:


[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:
    {jbossHomeName}/bin/add-user.sh -u admin -p admin-123
    {jbossHomeName}/bin/add-user.sh -a -u quickuser -p quick-123

For Windows:
    {jbossHomeName}\bin\add-user.bat -u admin -p admin-123
    {jbossHomeName}\bin\add-user.bat -a -u quickuser -p quick-123
----

If you prefer, you can use the add-user utility interactively. For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user[Add an Application User].

== Start the Server

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\standalone.bat
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build the artifacts:

----
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

== Access the Remote Client Application from the Same Machine

This example shows how to invoke an EJB from a remote standalone application on the same machine. Both the client and server are on the same machine, so the defaults are sufficient and no authentication is necessary.

. Be sure the quickstart deployed successfully as described above.
. Navigate to the root directory of this quickstart and type the following command to run the application. Be sure to replace `{jbossHomeName}` with the path to your {productName} installation.

----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/appclient.sh ear/target/app-client.ear#simpleClient.jar Hello from command line
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\appclient.bat ear\target\app-client.ear#simpleClient.jar Hello from command line
----

. Review the result. The client outputs the following information provided by the server application:

----
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-51) Main started with arguments
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-51)             [Hello, from, command, line]
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-##) Hello from StatelessSessionBean@myhost
----

. Review the server log files to see the bean invocations on the server.

----
 ClientContext is here = {Client =dev84, jboss.source-address=localhost/127.0.0.1:45315}
----

== Access the Remote Client Application from a Different Machine

This example shows how to invoke an EJB from a remote standalone Java EE application on a different machine. In this case, the client needs to define a properties file to define properties to connect and authenticate to the server. The properties file is passed on the command line using the `--ejb-client-properties` argument.

=== Configure Machine_1 (Remote Server Machine)

. Install {productName} on this machine.
. Add the application users to the {productName} server on this machine as described above.
. Start the {productName} server with the following command. Be sure to replace `MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of this machine. These arguments make the server accessible to the network.

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/standalone.sh -b MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS -bmanagement MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\standalone.bat -b MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS -bmanagement MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS
----

=== Configure Machine_2 (Local Client Machine)

. Install {productName} on this server. There is no need to add the application users to this server.
. Download the `app-client` quickstart to this machine.
. Create a `jboss-ejb-client.properties` file. This file can be located anywhere in the file system, but for ease of demonstration, we create it in the root directory of this quickstart. Add the following content, replacing `MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of `Machine_1`.

----
remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED=false
remote.connections=default
remote.connection.default.host=MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS
remote.connection.default.port=8080
remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false
remote.connection.default.username=quickuser
remote.connection.default.password=quick-123
----

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the quickstart.

. Deploy the `app-client` quickstart to the remote machine using the following command:

----
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.hostname=MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS [-Dwildfly.port=9099] -Dwildfly.username=admin -Dwildfly.password=admin-123
----

. Be sure that the quickstart deployed successfully and the server is running on `Machine_1` as described above.
. Type this command to run the `app-client` application:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}/bin/appclient.sh --ejb-client-properties=ejb-client.properties ear/target/app-client.ear#simpleClient.jar Hello from command line
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}\bin\appclient.bat --ejb-client-properties=ejb-client.properties ear\target\app-client.ear#simpleClient.jar Hello from command line
----

. Review the result. The client outputs the following information, which was provided by the application:

----
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-51) Main started with arguments
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-51)             [Hello, from, command, line]
[org.jboss.as.quickstarts.appclient.acc.client.Main] (Thread-##) Hello from StatelessSessionBean@theOtherHOST
----

. Review the server log files on the remote machine to see the bean invocations on the server.

----
 ClientContext is here = {Client =dev84, jboss.source-address=localhost/127.0.0.1:45315}
----

== Undeploy the Archive from the Local Machine

Follow these instructions if you are testing the quickstart on the same machine.

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server on the machine where the quickstart is deployed as described above.
. Open a command prompt on that server and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive from the local machine.

----
mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Undeploy the Archive from the Remote Machine

Follow these instructions if you are testing the quickstart on a different machine.

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server on the remote server machine, `Machine_1`, where the quickstart is deployed as described above.
. Open a command prompt on the local client machine, `Machine_2`, and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive from the remote server machine, `Machine_1`.

----
mvn wildfly:undeploy -Dwildfly.hostname=MACHINE_1_IP_ADDRESS [-Dwildfly.port=9099] -Dwildfly.username=admin -Dwildfly.password=admin-123
