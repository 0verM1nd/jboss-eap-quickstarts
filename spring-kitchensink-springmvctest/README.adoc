== What is it?

The `spring-kitchensink-springmvctest` quickstart demonstrates how to create an MVC application using JSP, JPA and Spring 4.x in {productNameFull}.

* This module adds `MemberMockMVCTest.java` to showcase a use case of `MockMVC` and `RestTemplate` to test the MVC aspect of the application.

* By using `@WebAppConfiguration` and `@ContextConfiguration` we tell Spring the configuration files we would like the tests to use.

* In  the `jboss-as-spring-mvc-context.xml` file, the `context:component-scan`
and `mvc:annotation-driven` elements are used to register both the non-rest and rest controllers.

* The controllers map the respective urls to methods using `@RequestMapping(url)`.

* To return JSON, the rest controller uses `@ResponseBody`.

* The datasource and entitymanager are retrieved via JNDI.

== Run the Arquillian Functional Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under
the root directory of this quickstart. Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point
of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.

To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

. Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.

. If you have a running instance of the {productName} server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

. If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the {productName} server, meaning the tests will start the server for you, type the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-managed
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn dependency:sources
$ mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
----
