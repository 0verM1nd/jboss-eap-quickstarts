The `ejb-asynchronous` quickstart demonstrates the behavior of asynchronous EJB invocations by a deployed EJB and a remote client and how to handle errors.

== What is it?

The `ejb-asynchronous` quickstart demonstrates the behavior of asynchronous EJB invocations in {productNameFull}. The methods are invoked by both an EJB in the deployment and by a remote client. The quickstart also shows error handling if the asynchronous method invocation fails.

This example consists of the following Maven projects, each with a shared parent.

[cols="30%,70%",options="headers"]
|===
|Project |Description

| `ejb`
| This project contains the EJBs that are deployed to the server.
| `client`
| This project contains a remote EJB client.
|===

The root `pom.xml` builds each of the subprojects in the above order and deploys the archive to the server.

// Add System Requirements

//*************************************************
// Add Use of JBoss Home Name
//*************************************************
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `ejb/target/{artifactId}-ejb.jar` to the running instance of the server.

* In the server log, verify that the application deployed successfully.

== Access the Application

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to start the client.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ cd client
$ mvn exec:exec
----

. Check the client output
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO: The server log should contain a message at (about) <date>, indicating that the call to the asynchronous bean completed.
INFO: Got the async result as expected => returning at <date>, duration was 200ms
INFO: Got the async result as expected after wait => returning at <date>, duration was 1500ms
INFO: Catch the expected Exception of the asynchronous execution!
INFO: Results of the parallel (server) processing : [returning at <date> duration was 5000ms, returning at <date>, duration was 3000ms]
----

. Check the server log. There should be two `INFO` log messages for the `fireAndForget` invocation.
+
First, you should see the following message.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
'fireAndForget' Will wait for 15000ms
----
+
The second message appears after the client is finished, approximately 15 seconds later.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
action 'fireAndForget' finished
----

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

This quickstart consists of multiple projects, so it deploys and runs differently in JBoss Developer Studio than the other quickstarts.

. Install the required Maven artifacts and deploy the asynchronous EJB quickstart project.
** Right-click on the *{artifactId}-ejb* project and choose *Run As* -> *Maven Install*.
** Right-click on the *{artifactId}-ejb* project and choose *Run As* -> *Run on Server*.
. Build and run the client side of the quickstart project.
** Right-click on the *{artifactId}-client* project and choose *Run As* -> *Java Application*.
** In the *Select Java Application* window, choose *AsynchronousClient - org.jboss.as.quickstarts.ejb.asynchronous.client* and click *OK*.
** The client output displays in the *Console* window.
. To undeploy the project, right-click on the *{artifactId}-ejb* project and choose *Run As* -> *Maven build*. Enter `wildfly:undeploy` for the *Goals* and click *Run*.

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.
