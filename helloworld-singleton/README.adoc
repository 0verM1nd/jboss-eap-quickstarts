The `helloworld-singleton` quickstart demonstrates an *EJB Singleton Bean* that is instantiated once and maintains state for the life of the session.

== What is it?

The `helloworld-singleton` quickstart demonstrates the use of an _EJB Singleton Bean_ in {productNameFull}. It is instantiated once and maintains its state for the life of the session.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

This example demonstrates a singleton session bean that maintains state information for 2 variables: `Increment A` and `Increment B`.

A counter is incremented when you click on the link to the variable name. If you close and restart your browser, or if you have multiple browsers, you can see that the counter always increments the last value. These values are maintained until you restart the server.

To test the singleton bean, click on either `Increment A` or `Increment B`. The result page will give you the current value of the variable.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

$ mvn dependency:sources
