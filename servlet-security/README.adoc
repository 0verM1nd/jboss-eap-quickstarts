The `servlet-security` quickstart demonstrates the use of Java EE declarative security to control access to Servlets and Security in {productName}.

== What is it?

The `servlet-security` quickstart demonstrates the use of Java EE declarative security to control access to Servlets and Security in {productNameFull}.

When you deploy this example, two users are automatically created for you: user `quickstartUser` with password `quickstartPwd1!` and user `guest` with password `guestPwd1!`. This data is located in the `src/main/resources/import.sql` file.

This quickstart takes the following steps to implement Servlet security:

. Web Application:
** Adds a security constraint to the Servlet using the `@ServletSecurity` and `@HttpConstraint` annotations.
** Adds a security domain reference to `WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml`.
** Adds a `login-config` that sets the `auth-method` to `BASIC` in the `WEB-INF/web.xml`.
. Application Server (`standalone.xml`):
** Defines a security domain in the `elytron` subsystem that uses the JDBC security realm to obtain the security data used to authenticate and authorize users.
** Defines an `http-authentication-factory` in the `elytron` subsystem that uses the security domain created in step 1 for BASIC authentication.
** Adds an `application-security-domain` mapping in the `undertow` subsystem to map the Servlet security domain to the HTTP authentication factory defined in step 2.
. Database Configuration:
** Adds an application user with access rights to the application.

----
User Name: quickstartUser
Password: quickstartPwd1!
Role: quickstarts
----

** Adds another user with no access rights to the application.

----
User Name: guest
Password: guestPwd1!
Role: notauthorized

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Configure the Server

You can configure the server by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-server.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file

** If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
** Back up the file: `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
** After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:

+
[subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
For Linux:  $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows:  __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat
----

. Review the `configure-server.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds security domain and HTTP authentication factory to the `elytron` subsystem in the server configuration and also configures the `undertow` subsystem to use the configured HTTP authentication factory for the Web application.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing {jbossHomeName} with the path to your server:

+
[subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
For Linux: $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-server.cli
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-server.cli
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following datasource was added to the `datasources` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ServletSecurityDS" pool-name="ServletSecurityDS">
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:servlet-security;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
    <driver>h2</driver>
    <security>
        <user-name>sa</user-name>
        <password>sa</password>
    </security>
</datasource>
----

. The following `security-realm` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<jdbc-realm name="servlet-security-jdbc-realm">
    <principal-query sql="SELECT PASSWORD FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ?" data-source="ServletSecurityDS">
        <clear-password-mapper password-index="1"/>
    </principal-query>
    <principal-query sql="SELECT R.NAME, 'Roles' FROM USERS_ROLES UR INNER JOIN ROLES R ON R.ID = UR.ROLE_ID INNER JOIN USERS U ON U.ID = UR.USER_ID WHERE U.USERNAME = ?" data-source="ServletSecurityDS">
        <attribute-mapping>
            <attribute to="roles" index="1"/>
        </attribute-mapping>
    </principal-query>
</jdbc-realm>
----

. The following `role-decoder` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<simple-role-decoder name="from-roles-attribute" attribute="roles"/>
----

. The following `security-domain` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<security-domain name="servlet-security-quickstart-sd" default-realm="servlet-security-jdbc-realm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper">
    <realm name="servlet-security-jdbc-realm" role-decoder="from-roles-attribute"/>
</security-domain>
----

. The following `http-authentication-factory` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-authentication-factory name="servlet-security-quickstart-http-auth" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="servlet-security-quickstart-sd">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="BASIC">
            <mechanism-realm realm-name="RealmUsersRoles"/>
        </mechanism>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
----

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `undertow` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="servlet-security-quickstart" http-authentication-factory="servlet-security-quickstart-http-auth"/>
</application-security-domains>
----

This configuration tells `Undertow` that applications with the `servlet-security-quickstart` security domain, as defined in the `jboss-web.xml` or by using the `@SecurityDomain` annotation in the Servlet class, should use the `http-authentication-factory` named `servlet-security-quickstart-http-auth`. If no `application-security-domain` is defined for a particular security domain, `Undertow` assumes the legacy JAAS based security domains should be used for authentication/authorization and, in this case, the security domain defined in the Web application must match a security domain in the legacy `security` subsystem. The presence of an `application-security-domain` configuration is what enables Elytron authentication for a Web application.

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
