[abstract]
The `messaging-clustering` quickstart does not contain any code and instead uses the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart to demonstrate clustering using ActiveMQ Messaging.

== What is it?

The `messaging-clustering` quickstart demonstrates the use of clustering with Apache ActiveMQ and {productNameFull}. It uses the link:../helloworld-mdb/README.adoc[helloworld-mdb] quickstart for its tests, so there is no code associated with this quickstart. Instructions are provided to run the quickstart on either a standalone server or in a managed domain.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Prerequisites

*IMPORTANT:* This quickstart depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart WAR for its tests. Before you continue, you must build the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart WAR.

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the helloworld-mdb quickstart.
Type this command to build the WAR archive:

----
    $ mvn clean install
----

See the helloworld-mdb link:../helloworld-mdb/README.adoc[README] for further information about this quickstart.

== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart

You can choose to deploy and run this quickstart in a managed domain or on a standalone server. The sections below describe how to configure and start the server for both modes.

_NOTE - Before you begin:_

. If it is running, stop the {productName} server.

. If you plan to test using a standalone server, back up the file:

----
{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml
----

. If you plan to test using a managed domain, back up the following files:

----
{jbossHomeName}/domain/configuration/domain.xml
{jbossHomeName}/domain/configuration/host.xml
----

After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace these files to restore the server to its original configuration.

=== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart to a Managed Domain

You configure the server by running the install-domain.cli script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

==== Start the server in domain mode.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server in domain mode:

----
For Linux:   $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/domain.sh
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\domain.bat
----

==== Configure the Domain Server and Deploy the Quickstart Using the JBoss CLI

. Review the `install-domain.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script creates the server group and servers and configures messaging clustering for testing this quickstart. You will note it does the following:

** Stops the servers
** Creates a server-group to test ActiveMQ Clustering
** Adds 2 servers to the server-group
** Configures ActiveMQ clustering in the full-ha profile
** Deploys the `helloworld-mdb.war` archive
** Restarts the servers.
. Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command to run the script:

----
For Linux: $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=install-domain.cli
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=install-domain.cli
----

You should see "outcome" =&gt; "success" for all of the commands.
3. Restart the server in domain mode as described above.

=== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart to a Standalone Server

If you choose to use standalone servers rather than domain mode, you will need two instances of the application server. Application
server 2 must be started with a port offset parameter provided to the startup script as `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100`.

Since both application servers must be configured in the same way, you must configure the first server and then clone it.

==== Start the Server in Standalone Mode using the Full HA Profile.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full-ha profile. This profile supports clustering/HA

----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}_1\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml
----

==== Configure the Standalone Server and Deploy the Quickstart Using the JBoss CLI

. Review the `install-standalone.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script configures clustering for a standalone server. You will note it does the following:
** Enables console logging. By default, the full HA profile does not log to the console, so this script enables it.
** Enables clustering and sets a cluster password
** Enables clustering in the RemoteConnectionFactory
** Deploys the `helloworld-mdb.war` archive
** Reloads the server configuration
. Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command to run the script:

----
For Linux: {jbossHomeName}_1/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=install-standalone.cli
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}_1\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=install-standalone.cli
----

You should see "outcome" =&gt; "success" for all of the commands.

==== Clone the {productName} Directory

After you have successfully configured the server, you must make a copy of this {productName} directory structure to use for the second server.

. Stop the server.
. Make a copy of this {productName} directory structure to use for the second server.
. Remove the following directories from the cloned instance:

----
{jbossHomeName}_2/standalone/data/activemq/bindings
{jbossHomeName}_2/standalone/data/activemq/journal
{jbossHomeName}_2/standalone/data/activemq/largemessages
----

==== Start the {productName} Standalone Servers with the Full HA Profile

When you start the servers, you must pass the cluster password on the command line to avoid the warning "AMQ222186: unable to authorise cluster control".

If you are using Linux:

----
    Server 1: {jbossHomeName}_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
    Server 2: {jbossHomeName}_2/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

If you are using Windows:

----
    Server 1: {jbossHomeName}_1\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml
    Server 2: {jbossHomeName}_2\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

== Remove the Server Configuration

=== Remove the Domain Server Configuration

You can remove the domain configuration by manually restoring the back-up copies the configuration files or by running the JBoss CLI Script.

==== Remove the Domain Server Configuration Manually

_Note: This method ensures the server is restored to its prior configuration._

. If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
. Restore the `{jbossHomeName}/domain/configuration/domain.xml` and `{jbossHomeName}/domain/configuration/host.xml` files with the back-up copies of the files. Be sure to replace {jbossHomeName} with the path to your server.

==== Remove the Domain Server Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

_Note: This script returns the server to a default configuration and the result may not match the server configuration prior to testing this quickstart. If you were not running with the default configuration before testing this quickstart, you should follow the intructions above to manually restore the configuration to its previous state._

. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:

----
For Linux:   $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/domain.sh
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\domain.bat
----

. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing {jbossHomeName} with the path to your server.

----
For Linux: $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=remove-domain.cli
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=remove-domain.cli
----

_Note: If the `:stop-server` command does not complete before the next commands are issued, you may see an error similar to the following:

----
     {"JBAS014653: Composite operation failed and was rolled back. Steps that failed:" => {"Operation step-1" => "JBAS010977: Server (quickstart-messagingcluster-node1) still running"}}
----

Simply wait a few seconds and run the command a second time._

=== Remove the Standalone Server Configuration

You can remove the domain configuration by manually restoring the back-up copies the configuration files or by running the JBoss CLI Script.

==== Remove the Standalone Server Configuration Manually

_Note: This method ensures the server is restored to its prior configuration._

. If they are running, stop both {productName} servers.
. Restore the `{jbossHomeName}_1/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml` file with the back-up copies of the file. Be sure to replace {jbossHomeName}_1 with the path to your server.

==== Remove the Standalone Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

_Note: This script returns the server to a default configuration and the result may not match the server configuration prior to testing this quickstart. If you were not running with the default configuration before testing this quickstart, you should follow the intructions above to manually restore the configuration to its previous state._

. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:

----
For Linux:   {jbossHomeName}_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
For Windows: {jbossHomeName}_1\bin\domain.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml
