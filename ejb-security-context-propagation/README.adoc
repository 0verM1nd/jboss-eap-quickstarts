[abstract]
The `ejb-security-context-propagation` quickstart demonstrates how the security context can be propagated to a remote EJB using a remote outbound connection configuration

== What is it?

The `ejb-security-context-propagation` quickstart demonstrates how the security context of an EJB can be propagated to a
remote EJB in {productNameFull}.

The quickstart makes use of two EJBs, `SecuredEJB` and `IntermediateEJB`, to verify that the security context propagation is
correct, and a `RemoteClient` standalone client.

=== SecuredEJB

The `SecuredEJB` has four methods.

[source, java]
----
String getSecurityInformation();
String guestMethod();
String userMethod();
String adminMethod();
----

The first method can be called by all users that are created in this quickstart. The purpose of this method is to return a
`String` containing the name of the `Principal` that called the EJB, along with the user's authorized role information, for example:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[Principal=[quickstartUser], In role [guest]=true, In role [user]=true, In role [admin]=false]
----

The next three methods are annotated to require that the calling user is authorized for roles `guest`, `user` and `admin` respectively.

=== IntermediateEJB

The `IntermediateEJB` contains a single method. Its purpose is to make use of a remote connection and invoke each of the
methods on the `SecuredEJB`. A summary is then returned with the outcome of the calls.

=== RemoteClient

Finally there is the `RemoteClient` stand-alone client. The client makes calls using the identity of the established connection.

In the real world, remote calls between servers in the servers-to-server scenario would truly be remote and separate. For
the purpose of this quickstart, we make use of a loopback connection to the same server so we do not need two servers just
to run the test.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion}.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

To run these quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you need the {productName} distribution ZIP. For information on
how to install and run JBoss, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/[{productNameFull} Documentation] _Getting Started Guide_ located on the Customer Portal.

You can also run the quickstart in xref:run_the_quickstart_in_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse[JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse].

== Prerequisites

This quickstart uses the default standalone configuration plus the modifications described here.

It is recommended that you test this approach in a separate and clean environment before you attempt to port the changes in your own environment.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The
installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

[[add_the_application_users]]
== Add the Application Users

This quickstart uses secured management interfaces and is built around the default `ApplicationRealm` as configured in the {productName} distribution. You must create the following application user to access the running application.

[cols="20%,20%,20%,40%",options="headers"]
|===
|UserName |Realm |Password |Roles

|quickstartUser |ApplicationRealm |quickstartPwd1! |guest,user
|superUser |ApplicationRealm |superPwd1! |guest,user,admin
|===

To add the users, open a terminal and type the following commands.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest,user'
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'superUser' -p 'superPwd1!' -g 'guest,user,admin'
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\add-user.bat` script.

The `quickstart` user establishes the actual connection to the server.

If you prefer, you can use the `add-user` utility interactively.
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: link:{addApplicationUserDocUrl}[Add an Application User].

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-elytron.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file

** If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
** Back up the file: `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
** After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

. Review the `configure-elytron.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the configuration that enables Elytron security for the quickstart deployment. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-elytron.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
. Because this example quickstart demonstrates security, exceptions are thrown when secured EJB access is attempted by an invalid user. If you want to review the security exceptions in the server log, you can skip this step. If you want to suppress these exceptions in the server log, run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-system-exception.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows,use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

You should see the following result when you run the script:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `ejb3` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="quickstart-domain" security-domain="ApplicationDomain"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
. The following `ejb-outbound-configuration` authentication configuration and `ejb-outbound-context` authentication context were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<authentication-configuration name="ejb-outbound-configuration" security-domain="ApplicationDomain" sasl-mechanism-selector="PLAIN"/>
<authentication-context name="ejb-outbound-context">
    <match-rule authentication-configuration="ejb-outbound-configuration"/>
</authentication-context>
----
+
The `ejb-outbound-configuration` contains the authentication configuration that will be used when invoking a method on a remote EJB, for example when `IntermediateEJB` calls the methods on the `SecuredEJB`. The above configuration specifies that the identity that is currently authenticated to the `ApplicationDomain` will be used to establish the connection to the remote EJB. The `sasl-mechanism-selector` defines the SASL mechanisms that should be tried. In this quickstart the `PLAIN` mechanism has been chosen because other     challenge-response mechanisms such as `DIGEST-MD5` can't provide the original credential to establish the connection to the remote EJB.
+
The `ejb-outbound-context` is the authentication context that is used by the remote outbound connection and it automatically selects the `ejb-outbound-configuration`.

. The following `ejb-outbound` outbound-socket-binding connection was created within the `standard-sockets` socket-binding-group:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<outbound-socket-binding name="ejb-outbound">
    <remote-destination host="localhost" port="8080"/>
</outbound-socket-binding>
----
+
For the purpose of the quickstart we just need an outbound connection that loops back to the same server. This will be sufficient to demonstrate the server-to-server capabilities.

. The following `ejb-outbound-connection` remote-outbound-connection was added to the outbound-connections within the `remoting` subsytem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<outbound-connections>
    <remote-outbound-connection name="ejb-outbound-connection" outbound-socket-binding-ref="ejb-outbound" authentication-context="ejb-outbound-context"/>
</outbound-connections>
----

. The `http-connector` in the `remoting` subsystem was updated to use the `application-sasl-authentication` authentication factory. It allows for the identity that was established in the connection authentication to be propagated to the components.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-connector name="http-remoting-connector" connector-ref="default" security-realm="ApplicationRealm" sasl-authentication-factory="application-sasl-authentication"/>
----
. Finally, the `application-sasl-authentication` factory was updated in the `elytron` subsystem to include the `PLAIN` mechanism:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<sasl-authentication-factory name="application-sasl-authentication" sasl-server-factory="configured" security-domain="ApplicationDomain">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="PLAIN"/>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="JBOSS-LOCAL-USER" realm-mapper="local"/>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="DIGEST-MD5">
            <mechanism-realm realm-name="ApplicationRealm"/>
        </mechanism>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</sasl-authentication-factory>
----

. If you ran the script to suppress system exceptions, you should see the following configuration in the `ejb3` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<log-system-exceptions value="false"/>
----

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.jar` to the running instance of the server.

== Run the Client

Before you run the client, make sure you have already successfully deployed the EJBs to the server in the previous step and that your terminal is still in the same folder.

Type this command to execute the client:

----
$ mvn exec:exec
----

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the `mvn exec:exec` command, you see the following output. Note there may be other log messages interspersed between these.
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * IntermediateEJB - Begin Testing with principal quickstartUser * *

Remote Security Information: [Principal=[quickstartUser], In role [guest]=true, In role [user]=true, In role [admin]=false]
Can invoke guestMethod? true
Can invoke userMethod? true
Can invoke adminMethod? false

* * IntermediateEJB - End Testing * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * IntermediateEJB - Begin Testing with principal superUser * *

Remote Security Information: [Principal=[superUser], In role [guest]=true, In role [user]=true, In role [admin]=true]
Can invoke guestMethod? true
Can invoke userMethod? true
Can invoke adminMethod? true

* * IntermediateEJB - End Testing * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
----

As can be seen from the output the identities authenticated to the intermediate EJB were propagated all the way to the remote
secured EJB and their roles have been correctly evaluated.

== Investigate the Server Console Output

If you did not run the script to suppress system exceptions, you should see the following exceptions in the {productName}
server console or log. The exceptions are logged for each of the tests where a request is rejected because the user is not
authorized.
