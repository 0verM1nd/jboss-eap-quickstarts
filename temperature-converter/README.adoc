[abstract]
The `temperature-converter` quickstart does temperature conversion using an *EJB Stateless Session Bean* (SLSB), *CDI*, and a *JSF* front-end client.

== What is it?

The `temperature-converter` example demonstrates the use of an _EJB Stateless Session Bean_ (SLSB) and _CDI_, accessed using a _JSF_, and deployed to {productNameFull} using a WAR archive.

The application does the following:

. The User Interface is a JSF page that asks for a temperature and a scale (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
. When you click on `Convert`, the temperature string is passed to the TemperatureConverter controller (managed) bean.
. The managed bean then invokes the `convert()` method of the injected TemperatureConvertEJB (notice the field annotated with @Inject).
. The response from TemperatureConvertEJB is stored in the `temperature` field of the managed bean.
. The managed bean is annotated as @SessionScoped, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session.

== System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build this project is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server:

[subs=normal]
----
For Linux:   $ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: __{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

----
$ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

You will be presented with a simple form for temperature conversion.

. Optionally, Select a scale: Celsius or Fahrenheit.
. Enter a temperature.
. Press the `Convert` button to see the results.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
  $ mvn dependency:sources
