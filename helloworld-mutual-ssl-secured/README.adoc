[abstract]
The `helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured` quickstart demonstrates securing a Web application using client mutual SSL authentication and role-based access control

== What is it?

This example demonstrates the configuration of _mutual SSL authentication_ in {productNameFull} {productVersion} to secure a war application.

Mutual SSL provides the same security as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server would request the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must buy and maintain a digital certificate. We can secure our war application deployed over {productName} with mutual(two-way) client certificate authentication and provide access permissions or privileges to legitimate users.

This quickstart shows how to configure {productName} to enable TLS/SSL configuration for the new {productName} `undertow` subsystem and enable mutual (two-way) SSL authentication for clients in order to secure a WAR application with restricted access.

== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build these projects is {buildRequirements}. See link:{configureMavenDocUrl}[Configure Maven to Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

To run these quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you need the {productName} distribution ZIP. For information on how to install and run {productName}, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/[{productNameFull} Documentation] _Getting Started Guide_ located on the Customer Portal.

You can also use <<use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts,JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse>> to run the quickstarts.

== Use of {jbossHomeName}

In the following instructions, replace `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of {jbossHomeName} and JBOSS_HOME Variables].

== Add the Application Users

Using the add-user utility script, you must add the following user to the `ApplicationRealm`:

[cols="20%,20%,20%,40%",options="headers"]
|===
|UserName |Realm |Password |Roles

|quickstartUser |ApplicationRealm |quickstartPwd1! |JBossAdmin
|===

For the purpose of this quickstart the password can contain any valid value because the `ApplicationRealm` will be used for authorization only, for example, to obtain the security roles.

To add the application user, open a terminal and type the following commands:

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'JBossAdmin'
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\add-user.bat` script.

If you prefer, you can use the `add-user` utility interactively.
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: link:{addApplicationUserDocUrl}[Add an Application User].

. The certificates and keystores are now properly configured.

== Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the SSL context and required security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file

** If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
** Back up the file: `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
** After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing {jbossHomeName} with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.


. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `{jbossHomeName}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `key-store`s were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store name="qsKeyStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>

</server-ssl-contexts>
----

. The following realms were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store-realm name="KeyStoreRealm" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>

<aggregate-realm name="QuickstartRealm" authentication-realm="KeyStoreRealm" authorization-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
----

. The following `principal-decoder` and `security-domain` were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<x500-attribute-principal-decoder name="QuickstartDecoder" attribute-name="cn"/>

<security-domain name="QuickstartDomain" default-realm="QuickstartRealm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper" principal-decoder="QuickstartDecoder">

</application-security-domains>
----

== Test the Server SSL Configuration

To test the SSL configuration, access: https://localhost:8443

If it is configured correctly, you should be asked to trust the server certificate.

== Import the Certificate into Your Browser

Before you access the application, you must import the _clientCert.p12_, which holds the client certificate, into your browser.

=== Import the Certificate into Google Chrome

. Click the Chrome menu icon (3 dots) in the upper right on the browser toolbar and choose *Settings*. This takes you to chrome://settings/.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the *Advanced* link to reveal the advanced settings.
. Search for the *Manage Certificates* line under *Privacy and security* and then click on it.
. In the *Manage certificates* screen, select the *Your Certificates* tab and click on the *Import* button.
. Select the *clientCert.p12* file. You will be prompted to enter the password: `secret`.
. The client certificate is now installed in the Google Chrome browser.

=== Import the Certificate into Mozilla Firefox

. Click the *Edit* menu item on the browser menu and choose *Preferences*.
. A new window will open. Select the *Advanced* icon and after that the *Certificates* tab.
. On the *Certificates* tab, mark the option *Ask me every time* and click the *View Certificates* button.
. A new window will open. Select the *Your Certificates* tab and click the *Import* button.
. Select the *clientCert.p12* file. You will be prompted to enter the password: `secret`.
. The certificate is now installed in the Mozilla Firefox browser.

== Start the Server

. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of one of the quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

. In case mutual ssl is configured properly and war app is secured, you will be able to access the application only if the DN of client certificate i.e., `clientCert.p12` is same as the one mentioned in `app-roles.properties` file. It will otherwise result into a `HTTP Status 403` or forbidden error.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: https://localhost:8443/{artifactId}

A page displaying the caller principal and the client certificate used for mutual SSL should be visible:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
