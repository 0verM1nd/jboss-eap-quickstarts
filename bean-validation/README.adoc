[abstract]
The `bean-validation` quickstart provides Arquillian tests to demonstrate how to use CDI, JPA, and Bean Validation.

== What is it?

The `bean-validation` quickstart demonstrates how to use CDI, JPA, and Bean Validation in {productNameFull}. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java.

This quickstart does not contain a user interface layer. The purpose of this project is to show you how to test bean validation with Arquillian. If you want to see an example of how to test bean validation with a user interface, look at the link:../kitchensink/README.adoc[kitchensink] example.

This quickstart is a basic example of bean validation and is not localized. Because it is not localized, English messages are hard-coded in the constraint annotations in the `Member` class to ensure the test violation messages are matched when running the {productName} server using another language. For examples of localized quickstarts, see the `kitchensink-ml`, `kitchensink-ml-ear`, and `logging-tools` quickstarts.

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.


== Run the Arquillian Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:
+
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

You can also let Arquillian manage the {productName} server by using the `arq-managed` profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see link:{arquillianTestsDocUrl}[Run the Arquillian Tests].

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the tests, JUnit will present you test report summary:

----
Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

If you are interested in more details, look in the `target/surefire-reports` directory.

You can also check the server console output to verify that the Arquillian tests deployed to and ran in the application server. Search for lines similar to the following ones in the server output log:

----
INFO [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-5) WFLYSRV0027: Starting deployment of "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
...
INFO [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "test.war" (runtime-name : "test.war")
...
INFO [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-3) WFLYSRV0028: Stopped deployment test.war (runtime-name: test.war) in 32ms
...
INFO [[org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYSRV0009: Undeployed "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
----

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

----
WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work

== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a {productName} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:{useEclipseUrl}[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

----
$ mvn dependency:sources
