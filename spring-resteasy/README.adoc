== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

. This deploys the `target/{artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

That will provide links to the following URLs that demonstrate various path and parameter configurations.

* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/hello?name=yourname[{artifactId}/hello?name=yourname]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/basic[{artifactId}/basic]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/queryParam?param=query[{artifactId}/queryParam?param=query]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/matrixParam;param=matrix[{artifactId}/matrixParam;param=matrix]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/uriParam/789[{artifactId}/uriParam/789]

And the same set as above but using the `locating` path.

* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/locating/hello?name=yourname[{artifactId}/locating/hello?name=yourname]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/locating/basic[{artifactId}/locating/basic]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/locating/queryParam?param=query[{artifactId}/locating/queryParam?param=query]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/locating/matrixParam;param=matrix[{artifactId}/locating/matrixParam;param=matrix]
* http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/locating/uriParam/789[{artifactId}/locating/uriParam/789]

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Arquillian Functional Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under
the root directory of this quickstart. Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point
of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.

To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

. Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.

. If you have a running instance of the {productName} server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
----

. If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the {productName} server, meaning the tests will start the
server for you, type the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean verify -Parq-managed
----
