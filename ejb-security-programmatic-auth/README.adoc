[abstract]
The `ejb-security-programmatic-auth` quickstart demonstrates how to programmatically setup different identities when invoking a remote secured EJB.

== What is it?

The `ejb-security-programmatic-auth` quickstart demonstrates how to invoke a remote secured EJB using the `Elytron` client API to establish different identities. The quickstart client application accomplishes that by looking up and invoking the secured EJB under different `AuthenticationContext`s. Each context is setup to use a different identities and credentials.

[[add_the_application_users]]
== Add the Application Users

Using the add-user utility script, you must add the following users to the `ApplicationRealm`.

[cols="20%,20%,20%,40%",options="headers"]
|===
|UserName |Realm |Password |Roles

|quickstartUser |ApplicationRealm |quickstartPwd1! |guest
|superUser |ApplicationRealm |superPwd1! |guest,admin
|===

The first application user has `guest` access rights to the application but no `admin` rights. The second user has both rights.

To add the application users, open a terminal and type the following commands.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest'
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'superUser' -p 'superPwd1!!' -g 'guest,admin'
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\add-user.bat` script.

If you prefer, you can use the `add-user` utility interactively.
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: link:{addApplicationUserDocUrl}[Add an Application User].

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-elytron.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file

** If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
** Back up the file: `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
** After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
. Start the {productName} server by typing the following:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

. Review the `configure-elytron.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the configuration that enables Elytron security for the quickstart components. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-elytron.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `application-security-domain` mapping was added to the `ejb3` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="quickstart-domain" security-domain="ApplicationDomain"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
The `application-security-domain` essentially enables Elytron security for the quickstart EJBs. It maps the `quickstart-domain` that was set in the EJBs via annotation to the Elytron `ApplicationDomain` that will be responsible for authenticating and authorizing access to the EJBs.

. The `http-connector` in the `remoting` subsystem was updated to use the `application-sasl-authentication` authentication factory:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-connector name="http-remoting-connector" connector-ref="default" security-realm="ApplicationRealm" sasl-authentication-factory="application-sasl-authentication"/>
----
+
This allows for the identity that was established in the connection authentication to be propagated to the components.

== Start the Server

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to build and deploy the archive:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

. This will deploy `target/{artifactId}.jar` to the running instance of the server.

== Access the Application

Before you run the client, make sure you have already successfully deployed the EJBs to the server in the previous step and that your terminal is still in the same folder.

Type the following command to execute the client.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn exec:exec
----

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the `mvn exec:exec` command, you see the following output. Note there may be other log messages interspersed between these.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Called secured bean, caller principal quickstartUser

Principal has admin permission: false
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Called secured bean, caller principal superUser

Principal has admin permission: true
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
----

As expected, the `quickstart` user is able to call the methods available for `guest`, but does not have the `admin` permission to call administrative methods on the remote EJB. The `superUser` on the other hand has permissions to call both methods.

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the {productName} server as described above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. When you are finished testing, type the following command to undeploy the archive.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

[[restore_the_server_configuration]]
== Restore the Server Configuration

You can restore the original server configuration by running the `restore-configuration.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart or by manually restoring the back-up copy the configuration file.

=== Restore the Server Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

. Start the {productName} server with the default standalone profile by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server.

+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=restore-configuration.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

This script reverts the changes made to the `ejb3` and `remoting` subsystems. You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

=== Restore the Server Configuration Manually

. If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
. Replace the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file with the back-up copy of the file.

[[run_the_quickstart_in_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse]]
== Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools.
